In the upcoming Visual C++ 6.0, we'll have a view class wrapper for the Internet Explorer, providing
us with an html view.<br>
While waiting for VC6.0, we can have the HtmlView downloading the huge Tecno Preview from Microsoft.<br>
For those of you who needs, of all the Tecno Preview, only the HtmlView, I've "ported" it here. In the
demo there is a CHView class which is basically the CHtmlView from tecno preview.<br>

<H4>How to use it</H4>
You simply need to add the CHView files (ViewH.cpp and ViewH.h files) to your project; then copy the
directory "fromTecno" of the project in yours and add to your project the fromTecno\uuid.lib file.<br>
You'll need the 2 files in the fromTecno directory or the app won't compile (they are from the tecno preview).<br>
You'll also need to provide the command identifier for the HtmlView basic functions, ID_WEBBACK, 
ID_WEBFORWARD, .. look at the CHView message map); a fast way is to delete the IDR_MAINFRAME toolbar
of your app and put the one of the demo instead.<br>

Then derive manually the CView based view of your project from the CHView (use search / replace for
CView to CHView in your view header and cpp files).<br>
<br>
I added to the CHView a CString variable, csHomePage, holding the "homepage" to be opened at start; in the demo, 
I puttet this article you are reading in the "html" directory; to find the right path, I get the
startup directory in the app OnInitInstance, put it in a global CString csAppDir variable, find out
the path of the home page in the CHView contructor and load the html page in the CHView OnInitialUpdate.<br>
<br>
To load a page in the view, use the view Navigate2(url) function.<br>
Remember that is works only with Internet Explorer 4 installed on your system!<br>
