About  ZoomIn...

ZoomIn lets you use a hotkey to pop up a zoomed window. 
Since the keyboard and mouse remain fully functional, it is 
especially useful within paint programs. When the zoom window 
is displayed, the mouse is slowed to facilitate bitmap editing. 

ZoomIn is application-independent, and lets you configure the 
hotkey as well as the zoom factor and the pixel width. It runs 
under Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 or higher.

USAGE:

To install ZoomIn, copy its program files-ZoomIn.exe and 
KeyHook.dll-to a directory on your hard drive, and add a shortcut 
to ZoomIn.exe to your Startup menu. If you find that you use 
ZoomIn often, put the shortcut in your StartUp group so it's 
loaded automatically each time you start Windows.

When you run ZoomIn, it places its magnifying-glass icon in the 
system tray. To toggle the zoom window on an off, double-click 
the tray icon or press the ZoomIn hotkey. The hotkey is set to 
Ctrl+` by default because this is an uncommon key combination 
that you can press with your left hand (the opposite hand that 
most people use to maneuver the mouse). You can change the 
hotkey if you'd prefer something else.

The zoom window is a thinly outlined square containing a 
magnified copy of the area surrounding the mouse pointer. The 
small flashing square inside the window represents the location 
of mouse pointer. To zoom in on a specific area of the screen, 
simply move the mouse to that location. The ZoomIn window will 
follow your movements, typically staying at the lower right of 
the mouse pointer. If you move the mouse pointer to the extreme 
bottom or right side of the screen, the ZoomIn window will 
automatically move to the other side of the pointer to avoid 
moving off the edge of the screen.

What makes ZoomIn much more than a simple magnifier utility is 
that when the zoom window is displayed, you can still perform 
all of the usual mouse and keyboard functions. This is partic-
ularly useful in bitmap editors that require the use of the 
mouse. To exit ZoomIn, right-click its tray icon and choose 
Exit ZoomIn from the context menu.

ZoomIn lets you control four settings: the hotkey combination, 
the zoom factor, the zoom area, and the hotkey behavior. 
To change any of these properties, right-click the ZoomIn tray 
icon and choose Properties. Due to programming constraints, 
the hotkey is disabled while the ZoomIn Properties dialog box 
is visible, but you can bring up a test zoom window by clicking 
on the image of the globe.

To change the hotkey, put the cursor in the Hotkey edit box, 
then press the desired key combination. You must use key com-
binations that include Shift, Alt or Ctrl, and single keys 
cannot be used.

The Zoom Factor control lets you change the magnification of 
the ZoomIn window. A zoom factor of three means that one pixel 
on the screen will appear three pixels wide and three pixels 
high in the ZoomIn window. You can set the zoom factor to any 
value from two to six.

The Zoom Area control determines the size of the area that will 
be magnified in the zoom window. For example, if you set the 
zoom area to 25, the zoom window will magnify an area of the 
screen 25 pixels wide and 25 pixels high. You can set the zoom 
area to any value between 20 and 60.

The "Only display while hotkey is held down" checkbox lets you 
change the behavior of the hotkey. When unchecked (the default), 
the hotkey acts like a toggle; the zoom window stays visible 
until you press the hotkey again. If you check this option, 
the ZoomIn window will only remain visible while the hotkey is 
held down.

Note: The file ZOOM_SRC.ZIP contained in ZOOMIN.ZIP is the 
source code for ZoomIn.  This will only be of interest to you 
if you are a programmer, and can be discarded if you choose.
