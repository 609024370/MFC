		<H2>Introduction</H2>
		<P>Recently, I needed to display some JPG and PNG files. I had an old copy of 
			LeadTools and the open source libraries for both formats, but wanted my 
			executable to be as small as possible. So I decided to give GDI+ a try. I 
			quickly found GDI+ to be poorly designed and very quirky, but it worked well 
			for my purposes until I discovered, to my horror, that GDI+ cannot load JPG or 
			PNG images stored as resources!</P>
		<P>Like, I'm sure, other developers facing this issue, I disbelieved the 
			documentation and tried <CODE>Bitmap::FromResource</CODE> to no avail. While 
			perusing the Bitmap methods available, I ran across <CODE>Bitmap::FromStream</CODE>.</P>
		<P>After a bit of testing and several errors, due mostly to the horrible GDI+ 
			documentation, I came up with working code. After a night of rest, I decided to 
			encapsulate the code in a simple class to ensure memory got freed. The result 
			were two classes: <CODE>CGdiPlusBitmap</CODE> and <CODE>CGdiPlusBitmapResource</CODE>.</P>
		<H2>The Gotcha</H2>
		<P>Before discussing the code itself, there is a caveat with GDI+ that must be 
			addressed. With JPG, some TIFF and other formats, the original image 
			information must be available at all times. In other words, if you open a 
			bitmap using <CODE>Bitmap::FromFile</CODE>, you cannot delete or otherwise 
			change that file while the image is open. This same restriction applies to <CODE>CGdiPlusBitmapResource</CODE>. 
			(My testing found that PNG and BMP files don't seem to follow this 
			generalization, though I don't know if this is standard behavior or just a 
			fluke with my file set.)</P>
		<H2>GDI+ Initialization</H2>
		<P>GDI+ needs to be initialized before any GDI+ calls are made. I suggest adding 
			the following data member to the class derived from <CODE>CWinApp</CODE>:</P>
		<PRE>ULONG_PTR m_gdiplusToken;</PRE>
		<P>In <CODE>InitInstance()</CODE>, add the following calls:</P>
		<PRE>Gdiplus::GdiplusStartupInput gdiplusStartupInput;
Gdiplus::GdiplusStartup(&m_gdiplusToken, &gdiplusStartupInput, NULL);</PRE>
		<P>In <CODE>ExitInstance()</CODE>, add the following:</P>
		<PRE>Gdiplus::GdiplusShutdown(m_gdiplusToken);</PRE>
		<H2>The Class</H2>
		<P>I created two classes, with the base class being a very simple encapsulation of
			<CODE>Bitmap</CODE> and the derived class encapsulating the global memory. I 
			suppose that if I ever had the patience and desire, I could extend that class, 
			but I have no need to do so. (If you're curious why I didn't simply derive from 
			the ATL class <CODE>CImage</CODE>, it's because the code was used in a 
			program that didn't use MFC or ATL. However, the code is so simple, it could 
			easily be modified to use <CODE>CImage</CODE> as the base class.)</P>
		<P>I'm not going to bother going over the <CODE>CGdiPlusBitmap</CODE> class except 
			to say that it has a single, public, data member <CODE>Bitmap* m_pBitmap</CODE>. 
			(In the class I prefaced the GDI+ objects with the <CODE>Gdiplus</CODE> namespace 
			in case the developer doesn't want to declare <CODE>using namespace Gdiplus;</CODE>.)</P>
		<P>The <CODE>CGdiPlusBitmapResource</CODE> class has several constructors and 
			several overloaded <CODE>Load</CODE> functions. The overloaded functions simply 
			allow lazy programmers, like myself, to not have to type <CODE>MAKEINTRESOURCE</CODE>. 
			The main <CODE>Load</CODE> function takes the resource name and type as strings 
			and is the key to the class. This code follows in its entirety:</P>
		<PRE>inline
bool CGdiPlusBitmapResource::Load(LPCTSTR pName, LPCTSTR pType, 
                                  HMODULE hInst)
{
    Empty();

    HRSRC hResource = ::FindResource(hInst, pName, pType);
    if (!hResource)
        return false;
    
    DWORD imageSize = ::SizeofResource(hInst, hResource);
    if (!imageSize)
        return false;

    const void* pResourceData = ::LockResource(::LoadResource(hInst, 
                                                              hResource));
    if (!pResourceData)
        return false;

    m_hBuffer  = ::GlobalAlloc(GMEM_MOVEABLE, imageSize);
    if (m_hBuffer)
    {
        void* pBuffer = ::GlobalLock(m_hBuffer);
        if (pBuffer)
        {
            CopyMemory(pBuffer, pResourceData, imageSize);

            IStream* pStream = NULL;
            if (::CreateStreamOnHGlobal(m_hBuffer, FALSE, &amp;pStream) == S_OK)
            {
                m_pBitmap = Gdiplus::Bitmap::FromStream(pStream);
                pStream-&gt;Release();
				if (m_pBitmap)
				{ 
					if (m_pBitmap-&gt;GetLastStatus() == Gdiplus::Ok)
						return true;

					delete m_pBitmap;
					m_pBitmap = NULL;
				}
            }
            m_pBitmap = NULL;
            ::GlobalUnlock(m_hBuffer);
        }
        ::GlobalFree(m_hBuffer);
        m_hBuffer = NULL;
    }
    return false;
}</PRE>
		<P>I find the code very self explanatory, though those that know the return value 
			of <CODE>::LoadResource</CODE> is an <CODE>HGLOBAL</CODE> may find the apparent 
			double copy using <CODE>CopyMemory</CODE> confusing. In brief <CODE>CreateStreamOnHGlobal</CODE>
			requires a <CODE>HGLOBAL</CODE> handle allocated by <CODE>GlobalAlloc</CODE> using 
			the <CODE>GMEM_MOVEABLE</CODE> flag.</P>
		<H2>The Demo</H2>
		<P>The demo is a Visual Studio .NET 2003 project with ANSI and UNICODE builds. It 
			allows you to load resampled JPG or PNG resources (For the curious, I took both 
			photographs in Oahu, Hawaii for, and while filming content of, a multimedia 
			product. One is of Laie Bay, the other is a sunset viewed from Waikiki.)</P>
		<H2>GDI+ Disclaimer</H2>
		<P>I am not a GDI+ expert, nor am I a big fan, even if I do find GDI+ occasionally 
			very useful. Please don't ask me questions about it.</P>
		<H2>Why not IPicture?</H2>
		<P>I've been asked why I didn't use <CODE>IPicture</CODE>. The answer is threefold; 
			first, <CODE>IPicture</CODE> does not support PNG images. Second, <CODE>IPicture</CODE>
			is pretty much only an image loader, with little more capability than the 
			standard GDI bitmap calls. Third, <CODE>IPicture</CODE> decodes the image data 
			immediately. JPG and GIF images will use more memory than this class. </P>
		<H2>Updates</H2>
		<P>22 April 2004 <BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P><CODE>CreateStreamOnHGlobal</CODE> now uses <CODE>FALSE</CODE> for the second 
					argument since <CODE>Bitmap</CODE> requires that the memory be retained for at least JPG 
					images and I decided to err on the side of caution. Interestingly, my testing 
					showed this flag is often ignored, but I received reports that this wasn't 
					always the case and <i>was</i> technically incorrect.</P>
				<P>In addition, while fixing this bug I realized I wasn't clearing up the global 
					memory on failure. That resulted in the code being rearranged as it is now.</P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>15 June 2004 <BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>If <CODE>Gdiplus::Bitmap::FromStream</CODE> fails, I added what I believe is 
					redundant, but more correct code in handling <CODE>m_pBitmap</CODE>. 
					(Unfortunately, the documentation is silent on the subject as to whether NULL 
					will always be returned on failure.)</P>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
		<P>3 September 2004 <BLOCKQUOTE>
				<P>Added a section on GDI+ initialization.</P>
				<P>Fixed a potential memory leak on image load failure in the sample application.</P>
