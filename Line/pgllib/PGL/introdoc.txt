\section intro What is PGL ?
PGL is a dll-library developped for MFC and Visual C++ 6.0. It is designed to be fully
integrated in a MFC project. PGL is licensed under LPGL (see Section \ref slic)

Why another plot library ? Well, there are no (correct me if I'm wrong) free MFC plot library
available. PGL is designed to be used with a MFC application so you don't have to worry about porting
a plot library for Unix to windows. If you want a mutli-platform library use ROOT (root.cern.ch).

The aim of PGL is not to have a user-friendly environement but rather being able to generate
any plot from the source code.

PGL is hosted at

\section ssFeatures Features
<ul>
<li>line strip, fully customisable (color, line type, point type, line width,etc...),
<li>line strip with level of detail capabilities (based on Douglas-Peukler line simplification algorithm),
<li>Vector map,
<li>Height map,
<li>Text,
<li>Export to EPS, SVG, JPEG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, 
<li>CView derived class for fast integration in existing project,
<li>CDialog derived class,
<li>etc...
</ul>

\section ssInstall Installation

To use PGL in one of your projects :
<ol>
<li>Install GDI+ (part of Microsoft SDK).
<li>Download Gdiplus.dll and make sure it is in the path,
<li>Install PGL using the Microsoft installer package (.msi) available at sourceforge,
<li>Add the directory with PGL binaries to your path. (by default it is C:\Program Files\PGL\bin)
<li>Add the include directory and lib directory to Visual C++ include/lib directories.
</ol>

That's it!


\section download Download
You can download the source/binaries at the source forge site :
<A href="http://www.sourceforge.net/project/pglmfclib"> <IMG src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=39540" width="210" height="62" border="0" alt="SourceForge Logo"></A>

\subsection ssbin Binaries
A Microsoft installer package is available at sourceforge. 

\subsection sscompile Compiling the sources
The sources of PGL are provided.
Open the workspace "Plot Graphic Library.dsw"
It contains 3 projects :
<ul>
<li>AlgoTools. Collection of Algorithmic classes.
<li>IGfx. Graphic library used by PGL
<li>IGfxTest. Test project for IGfx
<li>OGLTools. A useful library to handle OpenGL with Windows. Not used anymore but useful anyway.
<li>PGL. The graphic library
<li>Testpgl. An demo application.
</ul>

\section sStart Getting your project started
<ol>
<li>Add the following in your StdAfx.h file :
\code
#include "PGL.h"
\endcode
<li>Since PGL is using GDI+, you must initialize it :
	<ul>
	<li>Add the following variable to your CWinApp derived class
	\code
		ULONG_PTR m_ulGdiplusToken;
	\endcode
	<li>Add the following to the CWinApp::OnInitInstance() function to initialize GDI+
	\code
	// initialize gdi+ (gdi+ is in Gdiplus namespace)
	Gdiplus::GdiplusStartupInput gdiplusStartupInput;
	Gdiplus::GdiplusStartup(&m_ulGdiplusToken, &gdiplusStartupInput, NULL);
	\endcode
	<li>Add the following to the CWinApp::OnExitInstance() function to clean up GDI+.
	\code
	// shutdown GDI+
	Gdiplus::GdiplusShutdown(m_ulGdiplusToken);
	\endcode
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>
Your project should work fine now.
